# Rick and Morty Wiki Application
A fun and interactive character encyclopedia built using the Rick and Morty API.


## Features

-> Paginated list of characters (6 per page)
-> Clickable cards to view full character details
->Live-updating footer clock
->Opens character details in a new tab

## Challenges Faced

Debugged using console.log, found out that the renderCharacters() function wasnâ€™t being called due to a script loading error. Corrected file paths and confirmed data was rendering correctly.
## Issue : Clock not updating live

Used setInterval() to refresh the clock every second and confirmed formatting with toLocaleTimeString() and toLocaleDateString()
