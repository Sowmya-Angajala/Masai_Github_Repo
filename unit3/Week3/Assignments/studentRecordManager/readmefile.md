# 🎓 Student Record Manager

A basic web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to manage student records. The application enables adding, viewing, editing, deleting, searching, and sorting student data — all with **pure DOM manipulation** (no external libraries or storage).

### ✅ Add Student
- Fill in the form with the student's **Name**, **Batch**, **Age**, and **Score (0–100)**.
- On clicking **Submit**:
  - The student record is added to the table.
  - The form is **automatically cleared**.
  - Input values are validated before submission.

### ✅ View Records
- All student records are displayed in a **tabular format**.
- Each row includes:
  - Student details
  - **Edit** and **Delete** buttons

### ✅ Edit & Delete
- **Edit**: Click to populate the form with existing data and update the record after submission.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes the student from the record after confirmation.

### ✅ Search Functionality
- A live **search bar** allows you to filter students by **name**.
- Search is **case-insensitive** and updates in real-time as you type.

### ✅ Sort Functionality
- Two buttons let you sort the student table:
  - **Sort by Age (Ascending)**
  - **Sort by Score (Descending)**

### ✅ Bonus Features
- Displays the **total number of students**.
- Displays the **average score** of all students.
- Students scoring **above 80** are highlighted in **green**.
