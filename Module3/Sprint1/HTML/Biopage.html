    <h1>Introduction about myself</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>"Hi, I'm an MCA graduate with a strong interest in software development and a passion for exploring new technologies. I enjoy building efficient and user-friendly applications, and I'm always looking to learn and stay updated with the latest trends in tech. I'm particularly excited about opportunities where I can apply my skills to real-world challenges and keep growing as a developer."</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, which helps me relieve stress and stay physically active. I also like going for walks, especially in natural settings, as it allows me to clear my mind, appreciate the environment, and come back feeling refreshed and focused.</p>
