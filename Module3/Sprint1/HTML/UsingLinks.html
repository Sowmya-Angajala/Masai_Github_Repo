    <h1>Healthy Diet</h1>
    <h2>Balanced Diet</h2>
    <p>A diet that contains all the essential nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and vitamins in the proportion required for the normal growth and development of the body is called a balanced diet. The important components of a balanced diet are cereals, pulses, milk, fruits and vegetables, fats and oil. A balanced diet constitutes a healthy diet. Thus, we all should try to follow a balanced diet.A healthy diet consists of simple, natural and/or well-cooked foods which promote health and protect us from diseases. It keeps our organ systems functioning well. The diet that we consume is decided by our socio-cultural norms, lifestyle patterns and the type of activities we are engaged in. A healthy diet includes nutrition, nutrients, food groups, a balanced diet and special dietary requirements.</p>
    <h3>Role of Nutrients</h3>
    <p>Nutrients that we obtain through food have vital effects on physical growth and development. It also helps in maintaining normal body function, physical activity and health. Nutritious food is thus needed to sustain life and activity. A healthy diet must provide all essential nutrients in the required amounts. Requirements for essential nutrients vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. Dietary intakes lower or higher than the body requirements can lead to undernutrition or overnutrition, respectively.Eating too little food during certain significant periods of life such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy and lactation and eating too much at any age can lead to harmful consequences. An adequate diet, providing all nutrients, is needed throughout our lives. Eating a variety of foods from each food group is crucial for supplying the individual with all the essential nutrients that the body needs, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and water.</p>
    <h4>Special Dietary Requirements</h4>
    <p>The amount of food or nutrients required by a person in a day depends upon the need for energy. These needs are directly related to age and physical activity. During the rapid growth years, i.e. 12–22 years for boys and 12–18 years for girls, there is a gradual increase in daily food requirements. But as we grow old, our daily need for energy decreases. The amount of energy required by people engaged in low, moderate or high levels of physical activity differs. A sports person always needs to consume more calories than a non-sports person. Similarly, the dietary needs of a woman during pregnancy and lactation are higher.</p>
